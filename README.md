## Story

Many moons ago, stricken by a swirling maelstrom the like of which has never before or since been seen, the dread galleon Blackbeard's Terror was smashed by giant waves and torn piece from piece by the teeth of the wind, and sank without trace, into the inky darkness of the deep.

Sodden and bruised, like the first worms that ever crawled from the sea, the survivors of Blackbeard's crew crawled upon their bellies on the rocky beach of an unnamed island which rose like the oily back of some fell monstrosity from the dismal ocean, to safety, and the comfort of unconsciousness.

Morning dawned, and the pirates awoke. But they were not alone... the island - a holy island, of sorts - was riddled with rabbits, scuttling, wriggling, scratching, copulating rabbits! A plague of vermin to sully the earthly tomb of a Great Old One! For at the very centre of the island, the pirates discovered the fallen ruins of an ancient ziggurat, and were overcome with a primal urge to raise it once again, as magnificent and dreadful as it surely had been in aeons past.

But how?

The rabbit vermin must pay. Sacrifices must be made...

For that is not dead which can eternal lie! Iä! Iä!

## Instructions

Welcome to the island of Pthleng, Great One. Iä! Iä!

Only the raising of the ancient ziggurat Ubbo-Sathla will restore you once more to this world.

This requires that sacrifices must be made. Bunnies. All of them.

Allow terror to spread for the ritual to begin, thus:

Caress the mortal with your left tentacle to bring motivation to his puny mind.

Slap the ground with your right tentacle to bring a hateful hoppity rabbit up from his hole.

But beware. The vermin seem to calm our servants. They work against us! Maintain the horror!

A mortal that knows too much horror is a useless mortal.

A mortal that does not know fear is a useless mortal.

Proceed, Great One! Iä! Iä!
